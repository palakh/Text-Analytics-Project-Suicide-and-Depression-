I don't know what you've gone through but one thing I've learned is that it doesn't really matter. You can have a seemingly perfect life but you can still be depressed. Other people can go through hell and not be depressed at all. It's how your brain is wired which can be affected by both genetics and you're environment. It may not be possible right now, but work on getting in a better environment, maybe get a fresh start. Talk it out with people and just try your absolute hardest to think more positive. Instead of focusing on the bad, focus on the good. I'm not saying you'll be perfectly fine all of a sudden because depression sucks, but it's a step in the right direction. Please don't give up and if you are myopically focused on getting better, you will see results. Good luck, hang in there.\",\n",
